      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         source, and configuration files.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
            replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
            the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
            comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
            file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
            same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
            identification within third-party archives.

         TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

         1. Definitions.

            "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
            and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

            "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
            the copyright owner that is granting the License.

            "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
            other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
            control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
            "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
            direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
            otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
            outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

            "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
            exercising permissions granted by this License.

            "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
            including but not limited to software source code, documentation
            source, and configuration files.

            "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
            transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
            not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
            and conversions to other media types.

            "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
            Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
            copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
            (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

            "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
            form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
            editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
            represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
            of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
            separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
            the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

            "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
            the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
            to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
            submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
            or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
            the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
            means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
            to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
            communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
            and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
            Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
            excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
            designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

            "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
            on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
            subsequently incorporated within the Work.

         2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
            publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
            Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

         3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
            this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
            worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
            (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
            use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
            where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
            by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
            Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
            with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
            institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
            cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
            or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
            or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
            granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
            as of the date such litigation is filed.

         4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
            Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
            modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
            meet the following conditions:

            (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

            (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and

            (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                the Derivative Works; and

            (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                as modifying the License.

            You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
            may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
            for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
            for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
            reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
            the conditions stated in this License.

         5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
            any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
            by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
            this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
            Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
            the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
            with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

         6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
            names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
            except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
            origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

         7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
            agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
            Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
            WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
            implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
            of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
            PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
            appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
            risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

         8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
            whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
            unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
            negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
            liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
            incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
            result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
            Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
            work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
            other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
            has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

         9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
            the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
            and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
            or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
            License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
            on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
            of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
            defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
            incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
            of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

         APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

            To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
            boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

      3.1. Availability of Source
      Code. Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
      Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source
      Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
      include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
      Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
      recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
      obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
      through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 

      3.2.
      Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
      Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
      grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

      3.3. Required Notices. You must
      include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
      Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
      patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
      notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
      Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
      form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
      recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
      warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients
      of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
      clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
      offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
      and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
      such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms
      You offer.

      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute the
      Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under
      the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from
      this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
      and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter
      the recipients rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
      different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
      Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

      3.6. Larger Works. You
      may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
      product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are
      fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

      4. Versions of the License. 

      4.1.
      New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
      publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
      Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
      License. 

      4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
      distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
      the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
      Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
      prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
      subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You
      originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
      distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by the license
      steward. 

      4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and You
      want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use
      a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the
      license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
      license contains terms which differ from this License. 

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS
      TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
      COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER
      OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
      CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
      LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER
      THIS DISCLAIMER. 

      6. TERMINATION. 

      6.1. This License and the rights
      granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
      herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
      breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
      termination of this License shall survive. 

      6.2. If You assert a patent
      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
      Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
      You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging that the
      Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a
      Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial
      Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights
      granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
      (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
      Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
      Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such
      60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your
      claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
      unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 

      6.3. In
      the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses
      that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
      termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive
      termination. 

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER
      NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
      SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
      COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
      PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
      CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
      GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
      LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO
      THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
      ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a commercial item, as that term is defined in
      48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software (as
      that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer
      software documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
      1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
      227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
      with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is
      in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
      that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
      License. 

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.
      This License represents the complete agreement
      concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
      make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
      jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
      License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
      limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
      Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
      the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
      apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
      with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
      laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
      otherwise make available any Covered Software. 

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
      utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
      Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
      basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
      of liability.

      Any Covered Software that You distribute or
      otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in
      Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy
      of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make

      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
      Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
      recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,

      Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
      3.6. Larger Works.
      You

      fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.
      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
      new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a

      than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
      4.2. Effect of New Versions.
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
      Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
      which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer
      includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed
      or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You
      must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
      version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
      Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
      published by the license steward.
      4.3. Modified Versions.
      When You are an
      Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original
      Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
      rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward
      (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
      make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
      License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
      OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
      IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
      NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED
      SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
      RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
      COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
      WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
      SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
      terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
      their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
      survive.
      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
      judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
      Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
      “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
      Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
      Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
      infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to
      You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not
      the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
      License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and
      automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
      such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
      Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
      agreement with Participant.
      6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim
      against Participant alleging that the Participant Software directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
      or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then
      the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
      2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
      payment or license.
      6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
      above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
      distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by
      any distributor) shall survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
      (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
      DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY
      SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
      FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN
      IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
      PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
      LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
      LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered
      Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101
      (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is
      defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software
      documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
      (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only
      those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
      and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
      Government rights in computer software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning
      subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
      make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the
      jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
      License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
      limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
      application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
      Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
      the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
      apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
      with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control
      laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
      otherwise make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
      utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial
      Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable
      basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
      of liability.

      Eclipse Public License - v 1.0

      THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
      LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
      CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.

      1. DEFINITIONS

      "Contribution" means:

      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
      distributed under this Agreement, and
      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      i) changes to the Program, and
      ii) additions to the Program;
      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
      distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
      Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
      acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
      the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
      conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not
      derivative works of the Program.
      "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.

      "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
      necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
      combined with the Program.

      "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.

      "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
      including all Contributors.

      2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
      reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such
      derivative works, in source code and object code form.
      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
      Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed
      Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
      Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.
      This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the
      Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
      addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations
      which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
      its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
      Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual
      property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
      Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of
      intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
      responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.
      For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to
      distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
      before distributing the Program.
      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright
      rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in
      this Agreement.
      3. REQUIREMENTS

      A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its
      own license agreement, provided that:

      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
      b) its license agreement:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
      conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and
      non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
      fitness for a particular purpose;
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
      damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
      damages, such as lost profits;
      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
      that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
      and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a
      medium customarily used for software exchange.
      When the Program is made available in source code form:

      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
      Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
      Program.

      Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
      any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
      originator of the Contribution.

      4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION

      Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
      respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
      intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
      includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
      which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
      a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
      Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
      every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
      and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
      actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
      extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
      connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
      offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
      relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
      to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
      Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to
      control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
      related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in
      any such claim at its own expense.

      For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
      offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
      Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
      related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
      Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
      Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
      Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
      requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
      Contributor must pay those damages.

      5. NO WARRANTY

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
      "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
      IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
      NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
      Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
      distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of
      rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the risks and costs
      of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,
      programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

      6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

      EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
      CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
      SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
      PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
      STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY
      OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
      GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      7. GENERAL

      If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
      law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
      terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
      provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
      provision valid and enforceable.

      If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
      (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
      infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under
      Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

      All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
      comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
      not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
      such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
      Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
      reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
      and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and
      survive.

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
      order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
      modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
      publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
      No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
      The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation
      may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable
      separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a
      distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always
      be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
      received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
      Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions)
      under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b)
      above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of
      any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
      estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under
      this Agreement are reserved.

      This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the
      intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this
      Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year
      after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in
      any resulting litigation.

      THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS
      PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR
      OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS
      LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

      BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
      BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED
      HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

      1. Definitions

      "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
      encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a
      number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in
      themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for
      the purposes of this License.
      "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other
      pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,
      fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction,
      abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work
      will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For
      the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
      recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
      ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
      License.
      "Licensor" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms
      of this License.
      "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work.
      "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of
      this License.
      "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has
      not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or
      who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under
      this License despite a previous violation.
      2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
      restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
      the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
      applicable laws.

      3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
      hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
      duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
      as stated below:

      to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective
      Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
      to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
      to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
      perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
      incorporated in Collective Works;
      to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and
      perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
      For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:

      Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive
      right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g.
      ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital
      performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
      Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right
      to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated
      agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the
      Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created
      by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
      jurisdictions).
      Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
      Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect,
      whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange),
      royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject
      to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act
      (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
      The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
      hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
      as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
      All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

      4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
      to and limited by the following restrictions:

      You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
      perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a
      copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or
      phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
      that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of
      the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
      publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control
      access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
      License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective
      Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself
      to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
      Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
      from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If
      You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by
      clause 4(b), as requested.
      If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
      perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep
      intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium
      or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym,
      if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor
      designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
      journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
      other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work
      if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
      Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
      unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information
      for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use
      of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
      Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit
      will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner
      at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
      5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

      UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
      THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
      THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
      LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
      OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
      EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
      NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
      LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      7. Termination

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
      any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
      received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License,
      however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
      and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
      Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual
      (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
      above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license
      terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any
      such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that
      has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and
      this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
      above.
      8. Miscellaneous

      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective
      Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
      terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
      terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
      If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
      law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
      terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this
      agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
      make such provision valid and enforceable.
      No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
      consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the
      party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
      This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect
      to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
      representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not
      be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of
      the Licensor and You.

         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.

         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.

      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.

      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:

         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and

         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and

         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.

         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.

      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      terms of this License. You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
      Software You distribute or otherwise make
      available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable
      form as to how they can obtain such
      Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a
      medium customarily used for software
      exchange.

      3.2. Modifications.

      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
      terms of this License. You represent
      that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
      have sufficient rights to grant the rights
      conveyed by this License.

      3.3. Required Notices.

      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
      the Contributor of the Modification. You
      may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
      within the Covered Software, or any
      notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
      Contributor or the Initial Developer.

      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
      form that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may
      choose to offer, and to charge a fee
      for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
      recipients of Covered Software. However, you
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
      any Contributor. You must make it
      absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligation is offered by You alone, and You
      hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability terms You offer.

      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
      of this License or under the terms of a
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with
      the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not
      attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Covered
      Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
      absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of any such terms You offer.

      3.6. Larger Works.

      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License
      and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
      make sure the requirements of this License
      are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.

      Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised
      and/or new versions of this License from
      time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except
      as provided in Section 4.3, no one
      other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

      4.2. Effect of New Versions.

      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the
      version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
      If the Initial Developer includes a
      notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
      otherwise made available under any subsequent
      version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise,
      You may also choose to use, distribute
      or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by
      the license steward.

      4.3. Modified Versions.

      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
      Original Software, You may create and
      use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the
      license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that the
      license contains terms which differ from this License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
      THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
      AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
      HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein
      and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
      claim is referred to as “Participant”)
      alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
      the Participant is a Contributor or the
      Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any
      and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
      Initial Developer (if the Initial
      Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or
      2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
      days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
      expiration of such 60 day notice period,
      unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
      Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.

      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted
      by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
      granted to You by any distributor) shall
      survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
      YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
      SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
      SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
      MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
      PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
      LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
      RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS
      SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
      NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
      THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
      APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
      software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
      48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Software with only
      those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
      and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,
      or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
      software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
      If any provision of this License is
      held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This
      License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
      contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible
      for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’
      fees and expenses. The application of
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
      is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to
      this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
      United States export administration
      regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
      when You use, distribute or otherwise
      make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
      claims and damages arising, directly
      or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
      to work with Initial Developer and
      Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to
      constitute any admission of liability.

          Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
          in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
          and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
          of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
          copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
          or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
          Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
          Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
          through a medium customarily used for software exchange.

          3.2. Modifications.

          The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
          governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
          believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
          have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

          3.3. Required Notices.

          You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
          identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
          remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
          within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
          descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
          Initial Developer.

          3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

          You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
          Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
          this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
          offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
          liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
          However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
          the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
          absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
          liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
          to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
          liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
          result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

          3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

          You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
          the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
          choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
          provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
          and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
          limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
          the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
          Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
          it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
          are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
          Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
          every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
          Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

          3.6. Larger Works.

          You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
          other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
          the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
          sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
          Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

          4.1. New Versions.

          Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
          new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
          given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
          4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
          this License.

          4.2. Effect of New Versions.

          You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
          Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
          License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
          the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
          prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
          under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
          make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
          of the License under which You originally received the Covered
          Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
          otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
          subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

          4.3. Modified Versions.

          When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
          license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
          modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
          remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to

          make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
          License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

          COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE

          NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
          THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
          DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
          OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
          REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
          ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
          AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

          6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
          automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
          cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
          Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
          termination of this License shall survive.

          6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
          declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
          Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
          assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
          Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
          Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
          Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
          indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
          Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
          Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
          from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
          expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
          day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
          Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
          a written agreement with Participant.

          6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
          alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
          infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
          license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
          infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
          granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
          into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
          license.

          6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
          all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
          distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
          granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

          UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
          (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
          INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
          COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
          TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
          LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
          FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
          LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
          APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
          PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
          LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
          LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
          AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

          The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
          in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
          software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. �
          252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
          as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
          with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
          (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
          with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
          clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
          clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
          software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

          This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
          matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
          unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
          necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
          the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
          the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
          provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
          provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
          to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
          venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
          with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
          limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
          The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
          the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
          regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
          construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
          agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
          States export administration regulations (and the export control
          laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
          or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

          As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
          responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
          out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
          work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
          responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
          shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------

        The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991

      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
      Boston, MA 02110-1335
      USA

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
      of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

      Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
      share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
      intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
      make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
      License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
      to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
      Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
      Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
      Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
      freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
      service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
      free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
      to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
      restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
      distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
      or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
      You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
      And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
      (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
      distribute and/or modify the software.

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
      that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
      software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
      want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
      that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
      authors' reputations.

      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
      We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
      individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
      be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
      modification follow.

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
      the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
      to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
      either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
      to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
      verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
      (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
      "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
      covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
      the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
      covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
      (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
      is true depends on what the Program does.

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
      code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
      and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
      and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
      this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
      recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
      you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
      it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
      such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
      that you also meet all of these conditions:

          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
          whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
          thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
          under the terms of this License.

          c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
          announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
          that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
          warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
          conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
          (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
          normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
          is not required to print an announcement.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
      identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
      can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
      themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
      sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
      the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
      License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
      whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
      your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
      exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
      collective works based on the Program.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
      with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
      scope of this License.

      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
      under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
      Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
          and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
          of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
          customarily used for software interchange; or,

          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
          distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
          only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
          program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
          accord with Subsection b above.)

      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
      making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
      means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
      associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
      compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
      exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
      normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
      components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
      which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
      executable.

      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
      to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
      the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
      code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
      along with the object code.

      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
      except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.

      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
      signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
      distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
      prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
      modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
      its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
      Program or works based on it.

      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
      original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
      these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
      on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
      responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
      infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
      conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
      excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
      so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
      any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
      distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
      not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
      receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.

      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
      any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
      apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
      circumstances.

      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
      patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
      such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
      integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
      by public license practices. Many people have made generous
      contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
      system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
      the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
      software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
      a consequence of the rest of this License.

      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
      certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
      original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
      add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
      countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
      not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
      limitation as if written in the body of this License.

      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
      versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
      versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
      differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
      specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
      later version", you have the option of following the terms and
      conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
      the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
      Free Software Foundation.

      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
      programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
      author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
      Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
      sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
      two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
      software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

      NO WARRANTY

      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
      WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
      EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
      OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
      EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
      ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
      YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
      NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
      WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
      AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
      DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
      DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
      (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
      INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
      THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
      OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
      free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
      attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
      the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
      "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

          One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
          Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

          This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
          it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
          the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
          (at your option) any later version.

          This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
          WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
          MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
          General Public License for more details.

          You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
          along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
          Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA

      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
      when it starts in an interactive mode:

          Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
          Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
          `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
          it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
      appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
      you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
      could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
      school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
      necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

          Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
          program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
          James Hacker.

          Ty Coon, President of Vice

      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
      into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
      may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
      with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
      General Public License instead of this License.

      Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
      affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special

      Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
      the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
      permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
      modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
      not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
      Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
      code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
      distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
      Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
      distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
      all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
      since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
      included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
      Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
      further distribute the package.

      Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
      lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
      Exception or making modifications to this package which may
      subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
      software.

      CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
      making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
      conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
      combination.

      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
      permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
      executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
      modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
      terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
      independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that
      module.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or
      based on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this
      exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to
      do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement
      from your version.

           grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

           (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
           Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce, modify, display,
           perform, sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or portions
           thereof), with or without Modifications, and/or as part of a Larger Work;
           and

           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of
           Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for
           sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or portions
           thereof).

           (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the
           date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the Original
           Software available to a third party under the terms of this License.

           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1)
           for code that You delete from the Original Software, or (2) for
           infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the Original Software, or
           (ii) the combination of the Original Software with other software or
           devices.

           2.2. Contributor Grant.

           Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject to
           third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants
           You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:

           (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
           Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
           sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
           portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications,
           as Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and

           (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
           Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination
           with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make,
           use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
           Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and (2) the
           combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor
           Version (or portions of such combination).

           (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the
           date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the Modifications
           available to a third party.

           (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: (1)

           devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
           absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

      3. Distribution Obligations.

           3.1. Availability of Source Code.

           Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
           Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that
           Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.
           You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
           form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.
           You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
           as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
           reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software
           exchange.

           3.2. Modifications.

           The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed
           by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your
           Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient
           rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

           3.3. Required Notices.

           You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You
           as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any
           copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered
           Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
           attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

           3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

           You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
           Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
           or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge
           a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
           more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your
           own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
           You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
           indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
           agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
           liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result
           of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

           3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

           You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the
           terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which
           may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
           compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
           Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights
           in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
           distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
           license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
           this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
           Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
           Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
           Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

           3.6. Larger Works.

           You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code
           not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as
           a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
           this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

      4. Versions of the License.

           4.1. New Versions.

           Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
           versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a
           distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
           other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.

           4.2. Effect of New Versions.

           You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
           Software available under the terms of the version of the License under
           which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
           Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from
           being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version
           of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available
           under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
           received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
           distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms
           of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.

           4.3. Modified Versions.

           When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for
           Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this
           License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the
           name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from
           this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains
           terms which differ from this License.

      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

           COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
           WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
           DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
           ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
           WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
           (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
           NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
           CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED
           SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

           6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
           automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such
           breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by
           their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
           shall survive.

           6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
           judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
           Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to
           as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
           Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
           Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
           indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly
           or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
           Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
           Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from
           Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
           such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
           Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
           Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
           Participant.

           6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
           that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent
           where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to
           the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value
           of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall
           be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
           license.

           6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end
           user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor
           hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
           distributor) shall survive termination.

      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

           UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
           NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
           OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER
           OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
           INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
           LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
           OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
           SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
           THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
           PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
           APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
           THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
           EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

           The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
           C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as
           that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ? 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial
           computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
           (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
           through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire
           Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.
           Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR,
           DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in
           computer software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

           This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
           hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
           provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
           enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction
           specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the
           extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
           jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
           License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
           jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
           Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
           limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
           application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
           International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation
           which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against
           the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are
           responsible for compliance with the United States export administration
           regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other
           countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
           Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

           As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
           responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
           its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
           Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an
           equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
           constitute any admission of liability.

      ----------
      NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
      (CDDL)
      The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to
      this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
      Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
      with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite
      330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
      document, but changing it is not allowed.

      Preamble

      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
      and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
      guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
      software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most
      of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
      authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
      covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
      your programs, too.

      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
      General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
      distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
      that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
      the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
      do these things.

      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
      you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions
      translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
      software, or if you modify it.

      For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
      fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make
      sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them
      these terms so they know their rights.

      We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer
      you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
      modify the software.

      Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
      everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
      software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
      know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by
      others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

      Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish
      to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually
      obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent
      this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free
      use or not licensed at all.

      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
      follow.


      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

      0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
      placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
      this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or
      work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
      derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
      Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
      translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without
      limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

      Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
      this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
      restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
      constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
      running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

      1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
      you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately
      publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;
      keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
      warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
      along with the Program.

      You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
      your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

      2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
      forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
      or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
      these conditions:

         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
         you changed the files and the date of any change.

         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
         in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
         licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
         License.

         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
         you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
         ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
         copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
         you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
         these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
         (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
         such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
         an announcement.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
      sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
      considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
      its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
      works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
      work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
      this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
      and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
      right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
      Program.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
      Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
      distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
      License.

      3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section
      2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
      provided that you also do one of the following:

         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
         which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give
         any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing
         source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
         source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
         medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
         distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
         noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
         code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
         above.)

      The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
      modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the
      source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
      definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
      of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
      need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
      binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
      operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
      accompanies the executable.

      If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
      from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
      from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
      parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

      4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
      expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
      sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
      your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
      rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
      long as such parties remain in full compliance.

      5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
      However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
      or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
      accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
      work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
      so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
      Program or works based on it.

      6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
      the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
      copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
      rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
      parties to this License.

      7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement
      or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed
      on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
      conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
      License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
      obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
      consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those
      who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
      could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.

      If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
      particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the
      section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

      It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
      other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
      section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
      distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many
      people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
      distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
      system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
      distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
      choice.

      This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
      consequence of the rest of this License.

      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
      countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
      holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
      geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
      distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
      case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
      License.

      9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
      spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
      or concerns.

      Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
      a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
      you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
      or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
      Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
      version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

      10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
      whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
      permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
      write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
      Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
      all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
      software generally.

      NO WARRANTY

      11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
      PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
      IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
      IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
      NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
      PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
      ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

      12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
      ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
      PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
      SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
      TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
      RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
      THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
      PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


      How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
      to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
      everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

      To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
      them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
      of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
      pointer to where the full notice is found.

         One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

         Copyright (C)

         This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
         the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
         Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later
         version.

         This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
         ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS
         FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
         details.

         You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with
         this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple
         Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

      Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

      If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
      starts in an interactive mode:

         Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
         Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
         This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain
         conditions; type `show c' for details.

      The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
      parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
      called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
      mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

      You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
      if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is
      a sample; alter the names:

         Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
         `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

         signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
         Ty Coon, President of Vice

      This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
      proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
      it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
      this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead
      of this License.


      "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

      Certain source files distributed by Oracle are subject to the following
      clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only where Oracle
      has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words "Oracle
      designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as
      provided by Oracle in the License file that accompanied this code."

      Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
      combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU
      General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.

      As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
      permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
      executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to
      copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,
      provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and
      conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module
      which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,
      you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not
      obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
      statement from your version.

      party intellectual property claims, the
      Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
      license:
      (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by Initial Developer, to use,

      Software and/or as part of a Larger Work;
      and
      (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of
      Modifications made by that Contributor either
      alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such

      Software in the absence of Modifications
      made by that Contributor.
      3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Availability of Source Code.
      Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in
      Executable form must also be made available in
      Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
      Software You distribute or otherwise make
      available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable
      form as to how they can obtain such
      Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a
      medium customarily used for software
      exchange.
      3.2. Modifications.
      The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the
      terms of this License. You represent
      that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
      have sufficient rights to grant the rights
      conveyed by this License.
      3.3. Required Notices.
      You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
      the Contributor of the Modification. You
      may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
      within the Covered Software, or any
      notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any
      Contributor or the Initial Developer.
      3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
      You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code
      form that alters or restricts the
      applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
      choose to offer, and to charge a fee
      for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more
      recipients of Covered Software. However, you
      may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
      any Contributor. You must make it
      absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligation is offered by You alone, and You
      hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
      liability incurred by the Initial
      Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
      liability terms You offer.
      3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
      You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
      of this License or under the terms of a
      license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with
      the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not
      attempt to limit or alter the
      recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this
      License. If You distribute the Covered
      Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it
      absolutely clear that any terms which differ
      from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
      Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify
      the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as
      a result of any such terms You offer.
      3.6. Larger Works.
      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not
      governed by the terms of this License
      and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must
      make sure the requirements of this License
      are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
      4. Versions of the License.

      4.1. New Versions.
      Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new
      versions of this License from time to time.
      Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided
      in Section 4.3, no one other than the
      license steward has the right to modify this License.
      4.2. Effect of New Versions.
      You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
      Software available under the terms of the
      version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
      If the Initial Developer includes a
      notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or
      otherwise made available under any subsequent
      version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
      available under the terms of the version of
      the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise,
      You may also choose to use, distribute
      or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
      subsequent version of the License published by
      the license steward.
      4.3. Modified Versions.
      When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
      Original Software, You may create and
      use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove
      any references to the name of the
      license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
      (b) otherwise make it clear that the
      license contains terms which differ from this License.
      5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
      IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR
      A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
      WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT
      THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
      CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
      THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES
      AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
      HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

      6. TERMINATION.

      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
      if You fail to comply with terms herein
      and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
      Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
      actions) against Initial Developer or a
      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such
      claim is referred to as “Participant”)
      alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
      the Participant is a Contributor or the
      Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then any
      and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the
      Initial Developer (if the Initial
      Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or
      2.2 of this License shall, upon 60
      days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
      expiration of such 60 day notice period,
      unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
      Participant Software against such
      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
      Participant.
      6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that
      the Participant Software directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
      or settlement) prior to the initiation
      of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
      granted by such Participant under Sections
      2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
      payment or license.
      6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user
      licenses that have been validly granted
      by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
      granted to You by any distributor) shall
      survive termination.
      7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL
      YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
      SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF
      SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
      COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
      ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
      INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
      THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
      INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
      NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
      JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
      LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
      LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

      8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of
      “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
      252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer
      software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).
      Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
      48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
      Users acquire Covered Software with only
      those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of,
      and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR,
      or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
      software under this License.

      9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
      If any provision of this License is
      held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This
      License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
      contained within the Original Software
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding
      such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the courts located in the
      jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original
      Software, with the losing party responsible
      for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'
      fees and expenses. The application of
      the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
      is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
      against the drafter shall not apply to
      this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
      United States export administration
      regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries)
      when You use, distribute or otherwise
      make available any Covered Software.

      10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for
      claims and damages arising, directly
      or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree
      to work with Initial Developer and
      Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
      herein is intended or shall be deemed to
      constitute any admission of liability.

      NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE
      (CDDL)

      The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      California (excluding conflict-of-law
      provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
      jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the
      Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California,
      with venue lying in Santa Clara
      County, California.

    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
